DataTricks
==========

This is a simple Mathematica package for reading Excel worksheets,
intended for use with economic datasets.

Mathematica's standard tools struggle with large workbook files, and 
can not have a spreadsheet refresh its data sources.
DataTricks also allows range definitions (in R1C1 format) and named
ranges, so that range coordinates do not have to be hard-coded.

Documentation is available in *demo.nb*, or [at this page](https://gitreports.com/issue/kuperov/DataTricks).

This package is experimental, so use at your own risk. If you discover
problems, please [file a bug report](https://github.com/kuperov/DataTricks/issues/new).
