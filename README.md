DataTricks
==========

This is a simple Mathematica package for reading Excel data. It is 
particularly useful for economic datasets.

Mathematica's standard tools struggle with large workbook files, and 
can not have a spreadsheet refresh its data sources and recalculate.
It also allows the use of range definitions (in R1C1 format) and named
ranges, so that range coordinates do not have to be hard-coded.

A sample is available in the notebook *demo.nb*.
